# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

# 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

# (1+2+...+10) ^ 2 = 55 ^ 2 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
